## Supreme Mod Monitor
Hello, I am [Rock](https://www.twitter.com/rockkdev) from the team at [StormeIO](https://www.twitter.com/stormeio) and I have created this open-source mod.js monitor. It scans and waits for any changes on Supreme's mod.js file. Any changes to the mobile paramater will be sent to a webhook provided in the *config.json* file. I kindly ask you to not steal the code and rebrand it, at minimum keep the footer message.

## Extra

### Planned Additions
* More data on each mod file.
* Monitor desktop mod functions/checkout mod functions.

### Development

This is really easy to edit if you are proficient in NodeJS. I encourage any devs to make a fork and add any features they would like.
